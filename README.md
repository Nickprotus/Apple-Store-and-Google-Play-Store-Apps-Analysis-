# Apple-Store and Google-Play-Store Apps data analysis using python

For this project, I analyzed data for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The company is assumed to make it apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

The company only build apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of its apps determines its revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

The dataset for the project was downloaded from https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv

The goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

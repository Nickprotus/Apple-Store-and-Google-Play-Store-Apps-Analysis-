# Apple-Store-and-Google-Play-Store-Apps-Analysis-

For this project, I analyzed data for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

The company only build apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of its apps determines its revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. 

The goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
